# Infinite Emojis

Have you ever felt like there aren't enough ways to express yourself in Minecraft?

Wish you could show how you feel just as if you were texting an emoji to a friend?

Enter: Infinite Emojis!

Infinite Emojis is a Minecraft mod adding a variety of emoji-related features to the game.
Currently, emojis can be crafted out of base components like a face, eyes, and mouth,
and different variations can be put together to create all sorts of different expressions!

## This mod is still in development!

### The switch from Forge to NeoForge is in progress and taking place in the "neoforge" branch!

Along with porting to a new mod loader, the "neoforge" branch also targets Minecraft 1.21.1 instead of the older 1.20.6.

The porting process will take some time, but once I'm done I'll have the great resources of NeoForge to help make the modding process even easier.

### Currently, there are only 16 of the Unicode emojis in-game.

Many, many more are planned to be added as well as the ability
to combine any components together to create never-before seen emoji!

### Some other planned features include:
- Emoji mobs
- Realistic obtaining of emoji components
- Throwing emojis at other players to spread \<insert any emotion here>
- Emoji trees
- ...and more! Stay tuned!
